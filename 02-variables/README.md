## What is a Variable?

A variable in Go is a named storage location that holds a value of a specific type. Variables allow you to store and manipulate data in your programs.

## Declaring Variables

There are several ways to declare variables in Go:

1. **Standard Declaration**: 
   - Syntax: `var variableName variableType`
   - Example: `var age int`

2. **Declaration with Initialization**: 
   - Syntax: `var variableName variableType = value`
   - Example: `var age int = 30`

3. **Short Variable Declaration (Type Inference)**: 
   - Syntax: `variableName := value`
   - Note: Type is inferred by the compiler.
   - Example: `age := 30` (used within functions)

## Variable Scope and Visibility

- **Local Scope**: Variables declared within a function are local to that function.
- **Package Scope**: Variables declared outside of a function but within a package are accessible throughout the package.
- **Exported vs. Unexported**:
  - Variables with names starting with an uppercase letter are exported and accessible from other packages.
  - Variables starting with a lowercase letter are unexported and only accessible within their package.

1. **Exported Identifiers:**
   - If a variable, constant, function, type, etc., starts with an uppercase letter, it is considered exported.
   - Exported identifiers are visible and accessible from other packages.
   - This is analogous to public variables or methods in some other programming languages.
   - Example: `AppName`, `PrintDetails()`

2. **Unexported Identifiers:**
   - Identifiers that start with a lowercase letter are unexported.
   - They are only accessible within the package where they are declared.
   - This is similar to private variables or methods in other languages.
   - Example: `appVersion`, `calculateResult()`

1. **Main Package File (`main.go`):**
   ```go
   package main

   import (
       "fmt"
       "example/util" // assuming the utility functions are in "example/util" package
   )

   // Exported variable
   var AppName = "GoScopeApp"

   // Unexported variable
   var appVersion = "1.0.0"

   func main() {
       fmt.Println("Welcome to", AppName)
       fmt.Println("Version:", appVersion)

       // Accessing an exported function from the util package
       util.PrintAppDetails(AppName, appVersion)
   }
   ```

2. **Utility Package File (`util/util.go`):**
   - Assume this file is in a separate package named `util`.
   ```go
   package util

   import "fmt"

   // Exported function
   func PrintAppDetails(name, version string) {
       fmt.Println("Application:", name)
       fmt.Println("Version:", version)
   }
   ```

In this example:
- `AppName` in `main.go` is exported (uppercase) and is accessible from other packages, including the `util` package.
- `appVersion` in `main.go` is unexported (lowercase) and is not accessible from the `util` package or any other package. It's only accessible within the `main` package.
- The `PrintAppDetails` function in `util.go` is an exported function, making it accessible in the `main` package.

## Variable Types in Go

Go supports a variety of variable types:

1. **Basic Types**: 
   - Integers: `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`
   - Unsigned Integers: `uint`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`
   - Floating Point: `float32`, `float64`
   - Complex Numbers: `complex64`, `complex128`
   - Booleans: `bool`
   - Strings: `string`

2. **Composite Types**: 
   - Arrays
   - Slices
   - Structs
   - Maps
   - Pointers
   - Functions
   - Channels

3. **Interface Type**: Used to specify methods that a type must implement.

## Best Practices for Using Variables

- **Use Descriptive Names**: Choose names that clearly describe what the variable represents.
- **Short and Concise**: Prefer shorter names for local variables within a small scope and longer, descriptive names for global variables or variables with a larger scope.
- **CamelCase Naming**: Use `camelCase` for variable names (e.g., `totalAmount`, `userName`).
- **Minimize Scope**: Declare variables close to where they are used to reduce the scope and improve readability.
- **Immutable vs. Mutable**:
  - In Go, variables are mutable by default; their values can be changed.
  - For immutable "variables", use constants (`const`) which cannot be reassigned after declaration.
  - Example:
    ```go
    const pi = 3.14
    ```

## Using Variables

Variables in Go are used to store, modify, and retrieve data. You can perform operations on variables according to their types.

Example:
```go
var message string = "Hello, Go!"
fmt.Println(message) // Output: Hello, Go!
```
